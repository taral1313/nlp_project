0,Buy This Stock in 2022 and You Could Be Rich by 2032,"It may be time to consider adding real estate company Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN) to this list of world-changing innovators.
The company is pioneering the idea of iBuying, where companies use cash offers to buy and sell your house.
The company can buy more or less homes based on how the real estate market is doing, so the actual number of homes Opendoor buys can vary sequentially.
The only show in townUntil recently, the iBuying industry was a three-headed race that featured Opendoor, Zillow, and Offerpad.

Jose Najarro: For those other automobile companies that don't have the power like Tesla, they look to Nvidia for solutions.
That's where Nvidia is working, they're creating solutions for the other automobile industries or automobile giants that don't have maybe the type of talent or engineer that Tesla might have.

Let's say an automobile company, I need to create some servers, I need to have some servers, I can buy some pre-built servers from Nvidia.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/30/heres-how-nvidia-will-power-automotive-giants/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
2,Are Tesla's Promises of Self-Driving Cars Risky for Investors?,"When I first got that, that was before they had the current full self-driving chip.
We'll see if it turns out that the chip won't handle full self-driving, I would assume they would replace it.
You're going to get me hit.
If they get it right, they're going to be miles ahead of everybody else.
I think that's a fair assessment.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/30/are-teslas-promises-of-self-driving-cars-risky-for/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article

4,2 Reasons Elon Musk Can't Save Dogecoin,"On Tuesday, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk announced that he would eat a McDonald's Happy Meal on TV if the restaurant chain accepted Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) as payment.
While Elon Musk has historically influenced cryptocurrency markets, his power seems to be waning as investors start prioritizing fundamentals over baseless hype.
Let's explore why Elon Musk can't stop Dogecoin's relentless crash.
When Musk tweeted, ""My Shiba Inu puppy will be named Floki"" in June (a remark presumably meant to pump Dogecoin), rival Shiba Inu token soared instead -- rising by over 60,000,000% by late October, according to CNN.
Dogecoin was the first popular meme coin, but competition and poor fundamentals have sent it to the doghouse.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/29/2-reasons-elon-musk-cant-save-dogecoin/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
